## New Functionality

The new TypeScript-based `common` introduces some new features and improvements:

- **Client-Side Code**: A new `client` directory suggests the start of client-side logic being moved into the new `common`.
- **New Utils**: `deep-copy.ts`, `migrations.ts`, `performance.ts`, and `validate.ts` are new utilities that were not present in the `old_common`.
- **Improved Structure**: The new structure separates code into `client`, `server`, and `shared`, which is a good practice for code organization.

---

## Missing Functionality

The following is a summary of critical functionality that is missing from the new `common`:

- **Core Gameplay**:
  - Unit evolution (`evolve_library.luau`)
  - Item crafting (`crafting_library.luau`)
  - Leaderboards (`leaderboard.luau`)
- **Data**:
  - A large number of data factories for various game systems.
- **Constants**:
  - Almost all game constants, which are essential for game balance and content management.
- **Utilities**:
  - Several utility functions for formatting and asynchronous operations.

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Core Gameplay Libraries**: The libraries from the old system contain critical gameplay logic that needs to be rewritten.
2. **Complete Constants Migration**: This is now the highest priority - migrate 1,000+ constants from Registry system.
3. **Finish Utils Migration**: Complete the remaining 6 utility functions.
4. **Game Content Migration**: Plan systematic migration of 1,100+ game content items from Registry system.
5. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing to ensure parity between old and new systems.
6. **Migration Tools**: Consider building automation to help migrate large amounts of Registry data.

## Summary

**Completed:**
- ✅ Server Services (12/12)
- ✅ Data Factories (23/23)

**In Progress:**
- 🔄 Utils (5/11 complete)
- 🔄 Constants (1% complete)

**Not Started:**
- ❌ Core Gameplay Libraries (0/8)
- 🔄 Game Content Data (5/13 major systems, 70% complete)
