rewrite old_lobby at the root of the repo, look at old_lobby/src/server and see the original rewrite attempt in luau, I want you to also look at old_lobby/src/server/old_scripts to see the original scripts that were used in the old lobby, i want you to rewrite the old_lobby/src/server/old_scripts in typescript under places/lobby/src/server i want you to use old_lobby/src/server/old_scripts as reference, look at places/common/src on how the rewrite should look like, also use places/common/src using @common alias because common is scripts shared among both gameplay, afk, & lobby and use the player-data implementation and such for the lobby
